<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>
<i>Image-based relighting</i> (IBL) is a technique
to change the illumination of an image-based object/scene. In this
paper, we define a representation called the <i>reflected
irradiance field</i> which records the reflection from an object
surface irradiated by a point light source that moves on a plane.
This representation is dual to that of the light field. It
synthesizes a novel image under a different illumination by
interpolating and superimposing appropriate recorded samples.
Furthermore, we study the minimum sampling problem of the
reflected irradiance field, <i>i.e.</i>, how many point light
sources are needed during sampling. We find that there exists a
<i>geometry-independent</i> bound for the sampling interval
whenever the second-order derivatives of the surface BRDF and the
minimum depth of the scene are bounded. This bound ensures that
the error in the reconstructed image is controlled by a given
tolerance, regardless of the geometry. Experiments on both
synthetic and real surfaces are conducted to verify our analysis.
