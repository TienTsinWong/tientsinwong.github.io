<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>

In this paper, we propose a <i>real-time</i> and simple relighting method
for image-based computer graphics by utilizing widely-used <i>commodity</i>
texture-mapping hardware on ordinary PCs. Hence, real-time relighting for
web applications becomes possible without purchasing specialized hardware. 
We introduce the <i>reflected irradiance field</i>, as a dual of the light
field, to characterize illumination by using the two-plane parameterization
model.  This formulation not only introduces more freedom for controlling
light source positions, but also transforms the relighting problem to a
texture-mapping process.  To relight an image-based scenery, we warp the
texture-mapped patches.  Based on the superposition principle, we can
relight these intensity-modulated texture-mapped patches for each light
source and cache the resultant relighted images.  Illumination due to
multiple light sources can be efficiently achieved by blending these images
and real-time relighting is evidenced to be possible on commodity graphics
hardware, such as the Nvidia GeForce3.  To demonstrate its feasibility,
experiments on both synthetic and real-world objects are conducted.  For
capturing real-world scenes, a computer-controllable system is built so as
to precisely sample the reflected irradiance field.

<h3>Demo</h3> 
A demonstrative program <b>irrad</b> is available <a
href="/software/irrad/irrad.html">here</a>.



<h3>Movies</h3> 

The following movies demonstrate the relighting result of both real and synthetic object.
All movies are captured by DV in real-time, hence they demonstrate the real-time relighting
ability.
