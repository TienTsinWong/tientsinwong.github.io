<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>

<dd>In this thesis, we describe two approaches, geometry-based and
image-based, to address the problem of time-critical modeling and rendering.
Time-critical modeling and rendering aims to improve the rendering speed
using both modeling and rendering techniques. Improving the rendering time
enables interactive display of large scale complex scene. This is important
in many applications such as virtual reality, medical visualization, flight
simulation, etc.

<dd>We first describe a new geometry-based simplification algorithm, <i>
adaptive skeleton climbing</i>, which generates simplified mesh directly
from volume data. By partitioning the volume into variable-sized rectangular
boxes, the algorithm generates triangles to approximate the enclosed
isosurface adaptively (larger triangles approximate smooth regions and
vice-versa). Since we apply binary tree organization on each dimension of
the rectangular boxes, it allows more flexibility in forming rectangular
boxes which are not allowed in previous octree approaches. Therefore a
coarser mesh can be generated using the proposed algorithm.

<dd>Although generating simplified meshes can significantly reduce the
rendering time, the rendering speed is still dependent on the complexity of
the scene. Note that the scene can be arbitrarily complex. If the only goal
of the graphics system is to provide the visual experience, we can model and
render the desired image using previously recorded images (reference
images).  This leads to our development of image-based computer graphics.
For pure image-based rendering, the rendering time will now only depend on
the resolution of the images.

<dd>Since the illumination of the scene is fixed during image capture, the
illumination in the synthesized images is also fixed. We propose a novel
concept of measuring apparent BRDFs of image plane pixels to overcome the
unchangeable illumination problem in previous image-based approaches. By
treating the image plane pixel as an ordinary surface element and measuring
its apparent BRDF from the reference images, we can record the <i> pixel
BRDF</i>. Using this apparent reflectance information, we are able to
re-render the image-based scene/object under any desired illumination
condition.

<dd>The idea is verified by applying it  to various image-based data
structures, light field, Lumigraph and panorama. We also devise a
<i>practical compression scheme</i> to handle the huge amount of data of
pixel BRDFs.
