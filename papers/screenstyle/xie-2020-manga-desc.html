  Manga Filling with ScreenVAE </b>
  <i><b> (SIGGRAPH Asia 2020)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>

While automatic converting color comic to screened manga is doable, translating  a bitonal
screened manga to color comic is never done automatically before. The major 
bottleneck lies on the fundamental difference in characterizing how a region
is filled. While a color can be characterized at a single point, a screentone has
to be characterized by a region. To enable the effective automatic 
transation between the color comic and the screened manga, we propose to
unify such fundamental difference, by introducing an intermediate
representation, ScreenVAE map, which converts the region-wise screentone to
a point-wise representation.
