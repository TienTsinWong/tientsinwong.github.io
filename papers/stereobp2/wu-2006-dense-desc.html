  Dense Photometric Stereo
  </b> <i><b>(IEEE TPAMI)</b></i></font><br>
  <p>

Given the massive number of images captured for relighting, we can
accurately recover the normal and depth maps using <i>dense photometric
stereo</i>. Recovery is accurate even the lighting direction is not
precisely measured and there are substantial amount of shadow and specular
highlight (which causes much troubles to traditional shape recovery
algorithms).  Note that the <i>same</i> set of images is used for depth
recovery and relighting. No range scanner is required. <br>
