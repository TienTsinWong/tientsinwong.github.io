<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>
This paper introduces a practical approach for super-resolution, the process
of reconstructing a high-resolution image from the low-resolution input
ones. The emphasis of our work is to super-resolve frames from dynamic video
sequences which may contain significant object occlusion or scene changes.
As the quality of super-resolved images highly relies on the correctness of
image alignment between consecutive frames, we employ the robust optical
flow method to accurately estimate motion between the image pair. An
efficient and reliable scheme is designed to detect and discard incorrect
matchings which may degrade the output quality. We also introduce the usage
of elliptical weighted average (EWA) filter to model the spatially-variant
point spread function (PSF) of acquisition system in order to improve
accuracy of the model. A number of complex and dynamic video sequences are
tested to demonstrate the applicability and reliability of our algorithm.
