  Solid Texture Synthesis from 2D Exemplars </b>
  <i><b> (SIGGRAPH 2007)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>

  Solid texturing has been referred as a solution to texturing 
  without distortion and discontinuity for many years. But the 
  difficulties of obtaining 3D textures has not be eased for many 
  years too. It would be perfect if we can just take 2D photo and 
  create the similar 3D solid from it. This is exactly what we do.
