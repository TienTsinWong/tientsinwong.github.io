  Noise-Proofed SH

  <p>

  Storing precomputed lighting information (such as relighting, BTF, and
  PRT) with spherical harmonics (SH) can drastically reduce the data size.
  However, that is still far away from practical use as each vertex or pixel
  has its own SH coefficient vector (of, say, 25 x 25 elements). Further
  compression on these SH coefficients may carelessly introduce severe
  visual artifacts.  We digged up the underlying reason and introduced a way
  to <i>noise-proof</i> the SH coefficients, hence practical applications
  become feasible.<br>
