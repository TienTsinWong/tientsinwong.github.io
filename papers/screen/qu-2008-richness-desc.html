  Richness-Preserving Manga Screening </b>
  <i><b> (SIGGRAPH Asia 2008)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>

  Manga artists draw manga based on real photographs, but unfortunately by
  hand. We present a method to generate mangas from color photographs by
  maintaining the <b>color-distinguishability</b>, texture and tone. As
  screen patterns offer much variety than bitone, why don't we make better
  use of patterns during color-to-bitone conversion?  We try to screen red
  and orange regions with similar patterns, while red and blue regions with
  less similar patterns.  This is what we mean color-distinguisability.
