  DWT on GPU
  </b> <i><b>(IEEE TMM 2007)</b></i></font><br>
  <p>

  Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been widely used in recent years,
  e.g. JPEG2000 image coding standard.  But DWT is rather computational
  intensive when the data size is large.  Since most PCs come with a GPU, why
  don't we turn it into a powerful DWT engine? As there are many DWTs, we
  proposed a method to support various separable DWTs with various boundary
  extension schemes. This project started in 2003 and its source
  code has been released since 2004.  <br>
