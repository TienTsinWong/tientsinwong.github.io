<h3>Abstract</h3>
<dl><dd>

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been heavily studied and developed in
various scientific and engineering fields. Its multiresolution and locality
nature facilitates applications requiring progressiveness and capturing
high-frequency details. However, when dealing with enormous data volume, its
performance may drastically reduce. On the other hand, with the recent
advances in consumer-level graphics hardware, personal computers nowadays
usually equip with a graphics processing unit (GPU) based graphics
accelerator which offers SIMD-based parallel processing power. This paper
presents a SIMD algorithm that performs the convolution-based DWT completely
on a GPU, which brings us significant performance gain on a normal PC
without extra cost. Although the forward and inverse wavelet transforms are
mathematically different, the proposed algorithm unifies them to an almost
identical process that can be efficiently implemented on GPU. Different
wavelet kernels and boundary extension schemes can be easily incorporated by
simply modifying input parameters. To demonstrate its applicability and
performance, we apply it to wavelet-based geometric design, stylized image
processing, texture-illuminance decoupling, and JPEG2000 image encoding.
