  Cartoon Deringing

  Existing manga (or anime) are normally stored as JPEG (or MPEG). However,
  such BDCT encoding is not suitable for images with sharp edges, like
  manga/anime. Images are usually contaminated with annoying visual
  artifact. This paper presents an analogy-based deringing method to
  <b>synthesize</b> artifact-reduced images instead of traditional
  postfiltering approaches. Substantially visual and statistical
  improvements over existing methods are obtained.
