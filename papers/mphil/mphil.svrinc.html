<h3>Abstract</h3>
<dl><dd>
<dd>In this thesis, we tackle two computer graphics problems: 1) The modelling of
natural imperfections and, 2) Improvement on the clustered-dot space filling
curve halftoning method. 

<dd>The modelling of natural imperfections
is a technique to introduce blemishes onto the object surfaces
in order to achieve the goal of
realism. In this project, we present a new framework of modelling of
such surface imperfections. The framework consists of two phases:
Firstly, a tendency value, which represents the potential of 
a surface point of interest being imperfect (e.g. with scratches, rusted,
etc.), is calculated based on the
object orientation to all <i> abstract imperfection sources</i>.
It is then adjusted by
the external factors, like surface exposure, scraping and surface curvature,
etc. Secondly, a chaotic imperfection pattern is generated according to this
calculated tendency. We have applied this framework to model
two very common kinds of imperfections: dust accumulation and scratching. Some
promising images are resulted.

<dd>Two common problems exist in most of the existing digital halftoning
techniques. They are the presence of annoying visual artifacts and
ink smudging which introduces intensity error to the final appearance 
of the halftone. In 1991, a clustered-dot space filling curve halftoning
technique was proposed. It reduces both problems effectively. However,
a new problem arises. It suffers from excessive blurring when the cluster
size increases. In this thesis, we propose two improvements, <i>selective
precipitation</i> and <i>adaptive clustering</i>, on the
former method to minimize these blurring effects.
Selective precipitation outputs the sequence of black dots at
the position where the sum of the gray values of the corresponding pixels on
the original image is the highest. Adaptive clustering uses
a 1D edge detection filter to find the sharp edges and adaptively adjust 
the size of the clusters so that they would not cross over the sharp
edges. Hence, the sharpness of fine details is retained without the need of 
image pre-filtering. By calculating a Gibbs measure and the length of the 
perimeter of the resulting black pixels as objective image quality 
measures, we have shown that images dithered by our methods
do have better quality than the one produced by the original 
clustered-dot space filling curve halftoning technique.
