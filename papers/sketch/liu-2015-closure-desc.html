  Closure-aware Sketch Simplification </b>
  <i><b> (SIGGRAPH Asia 2015)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>


Existing methods in simplifying a sketch mainly consider the distance and
orientation similarities of strokes. Thresholding on them usually results in 
unsatisfactory simplifcation. In fact, humans also rely on
the depicting regions in understanding whether individual strokes are
semantically refering the same stroke. But regions are formed by strokes,
and strokes are interpreted by regions. See how we solve the
chicken-or-the-egg problem, by considering the closure gestalts.
