      <DD>Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are effective and robust methods for solving 
        many practical problems such as feature selection, electrical circuits 
        synthesis, and data mining. Genetic algorithm is a well-known
        example of evolutionary algorithms. However, they may execute for a long time 
        for some difficult problems, because several fitness evaluations must 
        be performed. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to parallelize 
        these algorithms. In this paper, we propose to implement a parallel EA 
        on consumer-level <em>graphics cards</em>. We perform experiments to compare 
        our parallel EA with an ordinary EA and demonstrate that the former is 
        much more effective than the latter. Since consumer-level graphics cards 
        are available in ubiquitous personal computers and these computers are 
        easy to use and manage, more people will be able to use our parallel algorithm 
        to solve their problems encountered in real-world applications. </DD>
