  Manga Inpainting
  </b> <i><b> (SIGGRAPH 2021)</b></i></font><br>
  <p>
  Manga inpainting has long been needed by the industry during the localization
  and the conversion to electronic manga. But it is mostly done by hand, due to
  the semantically poor  and  seam-obvious inpainting results of existing
  methods. We proposed the first effective deep learning based method for manga
  inpainting that produces semantically meaningful and screentone seamless
  results. Thanks to our previous screenVAE feature, we can avoid the confusion caused by
  the screentone. <br>
