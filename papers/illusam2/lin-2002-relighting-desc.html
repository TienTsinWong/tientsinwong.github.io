  Sampling Bound of Relighting

  <p>

  How many samples we should take along the lighting dimension in order to
  synthesize realistic images? If we know the answer, we can avoid wasteful
  oversampling and undesirable undersampling, during the relighting and
  precomputed lighting. This is exactly what this paper trying to answer. We
  went through an indepth analysis and obtained the theoretical sampling
  bound for relighting and precomputed lighting. To verify our bound, we
  even build a machine to precisely position the point light source.<br>
