<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>
Image-based relighting (IBL) is a technique to change the
illumination of an image-based object/scene. In this paper, we
define a representation called the <i>reflected irradiance
field</i> which records the light reflected from a scene as viewed
at a fixed viewpoint as a result of moving a point light source
on a plane. It synthesizes a novel image under a different
illumination by interpolating and superimposing appropriate
recorded samples. Furthermore, we study the minimum sampling
problem of the reflected irradiance field, i.e., how many
light source positions are needed. We find that there exists a
<i>geometry-independent</i> bound for the sampling interval
whenever the second-order derivatives of the surface BRDF and the
minimum depth of the scene are bounded. This bound ensures that
when the novel light source is on the plane, the error in the
reconstructed image is controlled by a given tolerance,
regardless of the geometry. We also analyze the bound of depth
error so that the extra reconstruction error can also be governed
when the novel light source is off-plane. Experiments on both
synthetic and real surfaces are conducted to verify our analysis.
