<h3>Abstract</h3>
<dl><dd>
<dd>Two novel suboptimal algorithms for mutual exclusion in
distributed systems are presented. One is based on the modification
of Maekawa's grid based quorum scheme. The size of quorums is
approximately <i>sqrt(2)sqrt(N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the number of
sites in a network, as compared to <i>2 sqrt(N)</i> of the original 
method. The method is simple and geometrically evident. The second 
one is based on the idea of difference sets in combinatorial theory. 
The resulting scheme is very close to optimal in terms of quorum size.
