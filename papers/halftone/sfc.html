<h3>Abstract</h3>
<dl><dd>
Halftoning techniques are used to display continuous tone pictures on
bilevel displays and printers (or on those with a very limited number
of shades). The most popular and well-known techniques are ordered 
dither and error diffusion. The latter produces aperiodic patterns
with limited low-frequency components, a useful property, but its
dispersed dots suffer from an excessive smudging, which is especially
objectionable on high-resolution devices. Ordered dither, on the 
other hand, is capable of clustering the dots produced by using a properly
designed dither matrix. However, a regular dither pattern is then 
clearly visible in the output picture. A comparison of most digital 
halftoning techniques can be found in the literature.

<dd>Recently, researchers have been investigating new halftoning techniques
that traverse images along a space-filling curve, based upon a Peano
curve algorithm of the last decade. The space-filling curve halftoning
is attractive because of the pleasant smooth grains in the resultant 
image and the aperiodicity of the halftone pattern. Velho and de Miranda
Gomes further proposed a clustered-dot space filling curve halftoning
algorithm that reduces the smudging problem. However, clustering the
dot naively would blur the image excessively. This gem presents two 
improvements, selective precipitation and adaptive clustering, used
to minimize blurring.
