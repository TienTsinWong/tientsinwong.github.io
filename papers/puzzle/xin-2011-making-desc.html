Making Burr Puzzles from 3D Models</b>
  <i><b> (SIGGRAPH 2011)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>

Burr puzzles have a long history and highly related to anicent Asian 
architecture. Without any screw, burr puzzle pieces can interlock 
each other firmly. Existing burr puzzles usually have more or less 
similar and boring appearance due to the complexity in designing 
puzzle pieces. In this project, we propose a method to break a given 
3D model into burr puzzle pieces. User can control the complexity of 
resultant puzzle by controlling the number of "knots" introduced 
into the model volume. We also show the rapid prototype pieces.
