  End-to-End Line Drawing Vectorization</b>
  <i><b> (AAAI 2022)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>

Line vectorization has long been an open problem. Many approaches have been
proposed, and they usually involve multiple steps that may be proned to
input violating the assumptions. In this project, we propose a neural model
that can take arbitrary line drawing as input and directly export vectorized
output, without the hassles of unstable intermediate steps.
