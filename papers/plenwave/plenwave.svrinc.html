<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>

<dd> The image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR) approaches allow the time
complexity of synthesizing novel images to be independent of scene
complexity.  Unfortunately, illumination control (relighting) is no longer
trivial under the image-based framework. To relight the image-based scenery,
the scene must be captured under various illumination conditions. This
drastically increases the data volume. Hence, data compression is a must. In
this paper, we describe a compression algorithm for an
illumination-adjustable image representation.  We focus on compressing
constant-viewpoint images. A divide-and-conquer approach is proposed. The
compression algorithm consists of three parts which exploit the
<i>intra-pixel</i>, <i>inter-pixel</i> and <i>inter-channel</i> data
correlations.  Experimental result shows that the proposed method not just
effectively compresses the data but also out-performs standard image and
video coding methods.
