  ABRDF and Image-based Relighting 
  </b> <i><b> (EGWR 1997)</b></i></font><br>
  <p>
 
  The earliest paper on image-based relighting from our group in 1997. We
  attempted to include the lighting into the image-based rendering framework. 
  So that we are able to change the viewpoint as well as the lighting.
  Our work is later commonly referred as <i>image-based
  relighting</i>.  In this paper, we introduced the concept of
  <i>apparent BRDF (ABRDF)</i>  of pixel, which is the aggregate function 
  of surface reflectance, shadowing, and other indirect illumination
  contribution.
