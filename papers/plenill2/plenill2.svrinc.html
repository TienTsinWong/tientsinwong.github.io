<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<dl><dd>

<dd> Image-based modeling and rendering has been demonstrated as a
cost-effective and efficient approach to virtual reality applications. The
computational model that most image-based techniques are based on is the
plenoptic function. Since the original formulation of the plenoptic function
does not include illumination, most previous image-based virtual reality
applications simply assume that the illumination is fixed. In this paper, we
propose a new formulation of the plenoptic function, called the <i>
plenoptic illumination function</i>, which explicitly specifies the
illumination component. Techniques based on this new formulation can be
extended to support relighting as well as view interpolation. To relight
images with various illumination configurations, we propose a
local illumination model, which utilizes the rules of image superposition.
We demonstrate how this new formulation can be applied to extend two
existing image-based representations, panorama representation such as
QuickTime VR and two-plane parameterization (light field and lumigraph), to
support relighting with trivial modifications. The core of this framework is
compression, and we therefore show how to exploit two types of data
correlation, the <i>intra-pixel</i> and the <i>inter-pixel</i> correlations,
in order to achieve a manageable storage size.
