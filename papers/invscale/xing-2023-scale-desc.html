  Scale-Arbitrary Invertible Image Downscaling </b>
  <i><b> (IEEE TIP 2023)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>
  Have you ever complained your image being degraded after posting over
  whatsapp, telegram, or facebook? This is because social media platforms
  usually scale down your image if its resolution is too large. Here,
  we provide a solution of encoding arbitrary high-resolution image details into the
  low-resolution ones, so that after posting the low-resolution images 
  on these social media platforms, we can still restore the high-resolution
  images and their details. Obviously, this technology  can also be 
  adopted by the social media platforms, to retain the high-resolution
  details of users' images without paying extra storage cost.
