  Structure-based ASCII Art </b>
  <i><b> (SIGGRAPH 2010)</b></i></font><br> 
  <p>

  It seems that ASCII art has no 
  market value with the wide availability of digital images. 
  Instead, ASCII art becomes even more popular and trendy with 
  the growth of the text-based communication channels, 
  such as SMS and instant messenger. But current ASCII art generation 
  is not satisfactory due to its dithering nature. We propose a method
  to generate structure-based ASCII art that mimics the 
  <i>structure of image content with the structure of 
  characters</i>.
