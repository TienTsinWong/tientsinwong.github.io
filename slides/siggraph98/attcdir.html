<h3>Description</h3> 

Traditional panorama is an image with fixed illumination.  The images shown
in this slide demonstrate a new image-based rendering technique. It allows
not just navigating the panorama, but also changing the lighting setup of
the scene shown in the panoramic image. The top image shows an attic
environment illuminated by a directional light source. The three bottom
images show three snapshots when the panorama is viewed perspectively. Some
curved lines are straightened. All results are generated from images, not
geometrical objects.
