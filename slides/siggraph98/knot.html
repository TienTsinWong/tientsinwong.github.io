<h3>Description</h3> 

This slide shows the latest result of a new multiresolution isosurface
extraction algorithm known as Adaptive Skeleton Climbing. It <i>directly</i>
extracts isosurfaces in multiresolution from the volume data <i>without</i>
going through any postprocessing mesh reduction.  The coarser mesh is
generated in a time comparable to the time marching cubes used to generate
the finest resolution mesh. This slide demonstrates the extracted
isosurfaces of a <i>mathematical knot</i> in four resolutions. The mesh
coarseness increases in the following order: top left, top right, bottom
left and finally bottom right. Note how the algorithm fits large triangles
to smooth regions and small triangles to regions with complex geometry in
order to preserve the details.
