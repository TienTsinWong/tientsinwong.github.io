<h3>Description</h3> 
Traditional panorama is an image with fixed illumination. The images shown
in this slide demonstrate a new image-based rendering technique. It allows
not just navigating the panorama, but also changing the lighting setup of
the scene shown in the panoramic image.  The top image shows a chessboard
environment illuminated by five spotlights, each with different intensity.
The three bottom images show three snapshots when the panorama is viewed
perspectively.  All results are generated from images, not geometrical
objects.
