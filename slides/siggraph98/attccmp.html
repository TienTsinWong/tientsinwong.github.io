<h3>Description</h3> 
Traditional panorama is an image with fixed illumination.  The images shown
in this slide demonstrate a new image-based rendering technique. It allows
not just navigating the panorama, but also changing the lighting setup of
the scene shown in the panoramic image. The top two images show an attic
environment illuminated by a directional light source from two different
directions. The bottom image shows the same attic environment illuminated
with 4 spotlights, each with different intensity.  Note how the blue and
white spotlights illuminate the scene. All results are generated from
images, not geometrical objects.
