<h3>Description</h3> 
Traditional panorama is an image with fixed illumination. The images shown
in this slide demonstrate a new image-based rendering technique. It allows
not just navigating the panorama, but also changing the lighting setup of
the scene shown in the panoramic image.  The top image shows an attic
environment illuminated by several spotlights, each with different
intensity. The three bottom images show three snapshots when the panorama is
viewed perspectively. Note how the blue and white spotlights correctly
illuminate the scene. All results are generated from images, not geometrical
objects.
