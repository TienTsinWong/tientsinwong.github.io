<h3>Description</h3>
A new image-based renderer allows changing the lighting setup of the
image-based object.  The image-based object is sampled under a single
directional light source with unit intensity. However, other types of light
sources can be used to illuminate the image-based object in the final
rendered result. The left image shows an image-based object illuminated by a
point light source, while the right one is illuminated by a directional
light source. Note the difference in the shadow. All results are rendered
from images instead of geometrical entities.
