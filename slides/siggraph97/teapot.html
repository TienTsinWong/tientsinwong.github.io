<h3>Description</h3>
These images show the result of a new image-based rendering technique. It
allows not just navigating the object, but also changing the lighting
setup of the image-based object. The left image shows an image-based teapot
illuminated with a light source from the right. The right one shows the result
illuminated with a light source from the top. Note that all results are
generated from images, not geometrical objects.
