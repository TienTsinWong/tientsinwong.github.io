<h3>Description</h3> 


McMillan proposed a pixel-by-pixel warping technique for view interpolation,
The visibility is solved WITHOUT depth-buffering. However it does not work
for arbitrary triangles (if we subdivide the image into triangles), hence
cannot utilize the rendering hardware to speedup the warping. We propose a
triangle-by-triangle image warping technique derived from epipolar geometry.
By drawing the triangles in an order determined by topological sort (O(n)),
the visibility problem is solved WITHOUT depth-buffering. We also generalize
the warping technique to cylindrical panorama. The slide shows three frames
extracted from the interpolation sequence. Note how the visibility is
correctly solved for the moving buildings.
