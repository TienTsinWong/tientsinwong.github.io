<h3>Summary of His Research Contributions:</h3>

<a name="invertiblex">
<b>Invertible Generative Model</b></a> In <i>SIGGRAPH Asia <b>2018</b></i>, we published a general
neural network framework for solving invertibility problems. It contains a pair of encoding and decoding
subnetworks for generating the desired visualizable content that can invert back to its
original input.  The encoding network encodes information into a visualizable
latent, such that the information can be decoded via a decoding network. 
The visualizable latent can be controled via the objective function or a
GAN.  Due to the flexibility and generality of our model, it can be
flexibily applied to many applications. We coin it as
<i>Invertible Generative Model</i>. This framework can be applied for information hiding, data
compression, and solving backward compatibility issues.  For example,
<b>[color &#8596; grayscale]</b>  we can
hide the color information of a color image in an <a
href="./papers/invertgray/invertgray.html">invertible grayscale</a>
(<i>SIGGRAPH Asia 2018</i>), so that this grayscale image can restore its color. 
<b>[color  &#8596; halftone]</b> Our framework is further challenged by
extending it to <a href="./papers/invhalftone/invhalftone.html">invertible
halftone</a> (<i>ICCV 2021</i>), as the halftone
image has a significant smaller solution space and its blue-noise
requirement.
<b>[stereo &#8596; mono]</b>  We can turn a binocular video into an ordinary monocular video (<a
href="./papers/invbino/invbino.html">mononizing binocular videos</a>,
<i>SIGGRAPH Asia 2020</i>) for full backward compatibility and higher
compression efficiency. 
<b>[video &#8596; image]</b> We can also produce a real live photo (<a
href="./papers/embedframe/embedframe.html">video snapshot</a>,
<i>IEEE TPAMI 2020</i>)), a normal still picture that can really animate, instead
of storing a video sequence for a photo.

<p>

<a name="manga">
<b>Computational Manga and Anime</b></a> Motivated by painstaking manual process of
manga/anime
production, Tien-Tsin Wong has started a new field of computational manga
and anime since 2005. The goal is to develop technologies for intelligently usage of
computers in manga/anime production. These technologies include <a
href="./papers/manga/manga.html">manga colorization</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH
2006</i>), 
<a href="./papers/artifact/artifact.html"> cartoon deringing</a> (<i>ACM
TOG 2006</i>),  
<a href="./papers/structurehalftone/structurehalftone.html">structure-aware
halftoning</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH 2008</i>), 
<a href="./papers/screen/screen.html">manga screening</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH Asia
2008</i>), 
<a href="./papers/3dcel/3dcel.html">anime stereoscopization</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH
Asia 2013</i>),
<a href="./papers/sketch/sketch.html">closure-aware sketch
simplification</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH Asia 2015</i>),
<a href="./papers/linelearn/linelearn.html">manga screen removal</a>
(<i>SIGGRAPH 2017</i>), 
<a href="./papers/colorize/colorize.html">two-stage sketch colorization</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH Asia 2018</i>),
and
<a href="./papers/screenstyle/screenstyle.html">manga filling
with screenVAE</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH Asia 2020</i>).
Manga colorization facilitates the conversion of original
black-and-white manga into color manga via a few scribbles. Hence it saves
the color manga production cost, and the style of converted color manga
preserves the same style as the black-and-white version. Structure-aware
halftoning and manga screening provide ways to turn the color photos into a
b/w manga background in a fully automatic manner. This frees up the effort
and time of manga artists, so that they can focus on the design of
foreground characters. His technologies have already drawn the attention of
companies in the industry. His work has been reported by Hong Kong <a
href="./press.html#press-manga">
media</a>.<p>


<a name="relight">
<b>Image-based Relighting</b></a> He pioneered in the field of precomputed
lighting. In 1997, he published the earliest work in the field of
image-based relighting and proposed the model of <a
href="./papers/lightfld/lightfld.html"> apparent BRDF</a> (ABRDF)
(<i>EGWR 1997</i>). It is further generalized to <a
href="./papers/plenill2/plenill2.html"> plenoptic illumination
function</a> (<i>IEEE TMM, 2002</i>). This work is cited by many researchers
and further extended by institutions worldwide. It has been taught in the
advanced graphics courses offered by several renown universities worldwide.
In 2005, his paper on plenoptic illumination function is further recognized
and awarded <a href="./press.html#press-ibr"> IEEE Transactions
on Multimedia Prize Paper Award 2005</a>. Besides the representation, he
also proposed practical encoding and rendering solutions by encoding the
data with <a href="./papers/plenwave/plenwave.html">spherical
harmonics</a> (<i>IEEE TCSVT, 2003</i>), 
<a href="./papers/srbf/srbf.html">spherical radial basis
function</a> (SRBF) (<i>IEEE TIP, 2006</i> and <i>GDC 2007</i>), <a href="./papers/pca/pca.html">
PCA</a> (<i>IEEE TCSVT, 2005</i>), and spherical wavelet, so that game
sceneries with ultra-realistic lighting effects can be rendered in
real-time. Hence the techniques can be applied in computer games
development. <p>


<a name="dust">
<b>Weathering Simulation</b></a> He also pioneered in the field of weathering
simulation. In 1995, he proposed to determine the surface exposure to
simulate <a href="./papers/dust/dust.html"> dust accumulation</a>
(<i>IEEE CGA, 1995</i>) and other <a
href="./papers/imperfct/imperfct.html">weathering phenomena</a>
(<i>EGWR 1997</i>), such as rusting, patina, and peeling. This <b>surface
exposure</b> is referred as the first <b>ambient occlusion</b>, which
becomes a popular technique to improve the photorealism of synthetic images,
in computer graphics. With his contribution, the synthetic imagery becomes
more realistic, because our real-world is full of imperfection or
weathering. His work on weathering simulation is also reported by the
best-selling computer graphics magazine (Randall Warniers, "<a
href="./press.html#press-cgw">Dirty Pictures</a>", in Computer
Graphics World, June 1998, pp. 50-60). His recent work of <a
href="./papers/gammaton/gammaton.pdf">gamma-ton
tracing</a> (<i>SIGGRAPH 2005</i>) provides an even more comprehensive
framework for simulating complex weathering phenomena.<p>


<a name="sphere">
<b>Sphere Maps</b></a> He has proposed and published a series of work on uniform
sampling and/or partitioning of sphere. Sphere map is an important tool for
rendering and many applications in other areas. By equally
sampling/partitioning the sphere, we can efficiently represent any spherical
function and fit it nicely in the computer memory. The techniques he has
published include, unicube (<i>IEEE TVCG</i>), <a href="./papers/isocube/isocube.html">
isocube</a> (<i>IEEE TVCG, 2007</i>), rhombic dodecahedron Map (<i>IEEE
TMM</i>), <a href="./papers/q2tree/q2tree.html"> spherical
Q2-tree</a> (<i>EGSR 2005</i>), uniform cubemap, <a
href="./papers/udpoint/udpoints.html">Hammersley and Halton points on
sphere</a> (<i>Journal of Graphics Tools, 1997</i>). This stream of work is
presented in the <a href="./papers/spheremap/spheremap.html"> <i>Game
Developers Conference 2007</i> </a>, an influential conference in the game
industry.<p>

<a name="gpgpu">
<b>GPGPU</b></a> Another significant contribution of Tien-Tsin Wong is in the
field of GPGPU. He is one of the earliest researchers on pursuing GPGPU
(general purpose computing on GPU). He proposed the first <a
href="./papers/ecgpu/ecgpu.html">genetic algorithm on GPU</a>
(<i>IEEE Intelligent Systems, 2007</i>) and the earliest GPU shader
realization of <a href="./papers/dwtgpu/dwtgpu.html"> discrete
wavelet transform</a> (<i>IEEE TMM, 2007</i>). He also proposed the first
high-quality pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) on GPU (<i>Shader X5</i>)
(early GPU has no bitwise operators equipped, making it difficult to
implement traditional PRNG). His work in GPGPU has significantly sped up the
classical algorithms that are usually referred as computational intensive
and slow in performance. Hence this makes these algorithms more
practical.<p>


<b>Chinese Visible Human</b> Another his contribution is in the <a
href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Evrcentre">Chinese
Visible Human project</a>. In this joint project, five bodies are sliced into
thousands of cross-sectional images. The one with the highest data
resolution requires more than 1T of storage. Compression and real-time
rendering of this massive data is challenging. With the advances in GPU
techniques, they have developed a real-time volume rendering algorithm on
ordinary PC. The technology hence overcomes the cost barrier which impedes
the wide usage of such massive data. The developed technology has been
patented. Besides, he has also contributed in medical visualization projects
including virtual endoscopy, virtual arthroscopy surgical simulation, and
virtual Chinese acupuncture.
