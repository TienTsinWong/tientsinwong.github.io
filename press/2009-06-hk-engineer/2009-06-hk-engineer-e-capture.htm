Two technologies, a vascular intervention simulation system (VISS) for
training doctors in vascular and interventional radiology (VIR)
operations, and a computational manga system (CMS) for improving the
efficiency of manga production, was showcased by the Chinese University
of Hong Kong (CU) at the International ICT Expo 2009 in April.<br>
<br>
The development of VIR has allowed doctors to perform image-guided and
minimally-invasive therapeutic operations through tiny pin-hole
punctures on patients’ bodies by using medical imaging devices and
high-technology medical equipment. <br>
<br>
VIR operations have become an indispensable standard component in the
modern medical arsenal and the demand in Hong Kong has increased
rapidly in recent years. However, safe and effective performance of
precise VIR procedures requires highly skilled doctors with specialised
training. The restrictions of the traditional training mode through
hands-on practice on animals and real cases call for the development of
a comprehensive computerised training system. <br>
<br>
Simulation systems for VIR training currently available in the West
have been developed from the data of local clients, focusing on the
treatment of diseases common in the West, and thus may not be
applicable to the Asian region. <br>
<br>
Since the end of 2006, Prof Heng Pheng-Ann of CU's Department of
Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering; and Prof
Simon C H Yu of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology &amp; Organ
Imaging, Faculty of Medicine, have jointly developed a VISS for
treating common diseases in Asia. The system makes use of patients’
data to reconstruct the 3D anatomic model of organs and vascular
network, and simulate the whole VIR procedures and patients’ bodily
responses, including the slight resistance to the leading wires and
micro-catheter, and patients’ respiration and blood flow. The system
can greatly enhance the effectiveness of VIR training and can also be
used for education and evaluation of medical personnel.<br>
<br>
Prof Heng is also involved in the development of CMS.  <br>
<br>
The production of manga (Japanese comics) is highly complicated,
time-consuming and labour-intensive. Coloured and black/white (b/w)
mangas are usually produced separately, leading to inconsistency in
styles between the two versions. Prof Heng and Prof Wong Tien-tsin of
the same department have developed the CMS to enhance the efficiency,
consistency and cost-effectiveness of manga production. <br>
<br>
The CMS comes with two functions: manga colourisation and manga
screening, which facilitates easy colourisation and de-colourisation. <br>
<br>
Using existing software to colourise regions without enclosed
boundaries create leakage as computers cannot identify the specific
perimeter for colourisation. The manga colourisation function
automatically identifies and simulates hand-drawn hatching and printed
screening patterns and fill up different regions with the right colours
quickly. <br>
<br>
The manga screening function mimicks the way a cartoonist lays screens
with different patterns to transform coloured images into b/w manga,
with a much more promising result than the traditional halftone
technique. The new technology helps cartoonists substantially reduce
time spent on preparing the background and focus more on the design of
characters. More on the CMS can be obtained from
