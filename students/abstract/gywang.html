<dd>The quantization procedure of block-based discrete cosine
transform (BDCT) compression (such as JPEG) introduces annoying
visual artifacts. In this thesis, we propose a novel
learning-by-example method to reduce BDCT compression artifacts in
high-contrast images (images with large smooth color areas and
strong edges/outlines), for example cartoon images. Our main focus
is on the removal of ringing artifacts that is seldom addressed by
existing methods. In the proposed method, the contaminated image
is modeled as a Markov random field (MRF). We 'learn' the behavior
of contamination by extracting massive number of artifact patterns
from a training set, and organizing them using tree-structured
vector quantization (TSVQ). Instead of post-filtering the input
contaminated image, we synthesize an artifact-reduced image.
Utilizing the proposed method, we show that substantial
improvement (both statistical and visual) is achieved. Our method
is non-iterative and hence it can remove artifacts within a very
short period of time.
