<dd> Evolutionary Algorithm (EAs) are inspired by a biological
phenomenon: Darwin's theory of evolution. They are effective and
robust methods for solving many practical problems such as feature
selections, electrical circuit synthesis, and data mining.
However, they may take a very long time to find the solutions
especially when the problems are large in scale and difficult.
This is due to the numerous fitness evaluations and complicated
evolutionary operations involved. A promising approach to overcome
this limitation is to parallelize these algorithms. In this
thesis, we propose a paradigm to implement parallel EAs including
Evolutionary Programming (EP), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) on consumer-level
graphics cards. New data structures, as well as novel algorithms,
are introduced. We performed intensive experiments to compare our
parallel EAs with an ordinary one and demonstrated that our
approach is much more effective. The experimental results show
that our approach achieves a significant speed-up up to a factor
of five. We are the pioneer of using consumer-level graphics cards
for Evolutionary Computation. We believe that this thesis provides
a guideline for the general scientific computation using graphics
processing unit (GPU) by identifying the features and limitations
of this newly arising parallel hardware.
