<dd> In recent years, image-based rendering has emerged itself as a new and
promising methodology in the computer graphics community. One research axis
focuses on generating the novel views. Another axis concentrates on the
study of varying illumination. However, the lighting conditions in current
research are very restrictive, like pure directional or point sources. In
this proposal, we describe a new method to efficiently render an image-based
object in an environment. Our methodology makes use of spherical harmonics
to represent the apparent BRDF of each pixel in an image. After transforming
the environment illumination into a spherical harmonic coefficient vector,
the new image is computed in the frequency domain. The resulting re-rendered
image faithfully represents reflections contributed by the whole surrounding
environment. Area light source, which is computationally inefficient in
geometry-based computer graphics, can also be faithfully accounted for.
