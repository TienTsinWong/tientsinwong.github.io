To create a realistic three dimensional digital model, one of the
ways is to directly capture the model from real object.
Information including geometry and images is acquired from real
object. Then, the model is constructed by fusing scattered images
onto the geometry. To reproduce the appearance of the original
object, existing methods usually fit the data using parameterized
reflectance model such as Lambertian model, Torrance-Sparrow
model, etc. However, these models usually are restricted for
specific surface properties, so a more robust
approach is needed.<p>
<dd>
Addressing the problem, a new system is proposed in this thesis.
In the system, instead of considering the parameterized
reflectance model, we interpolate the scattered radiance samples
(image pixels) over a spherical function for each surface point.
As a result, we can approximate the reflected radiance looking
from different directions. Besides, for efficient data storage,
radiances are encoded into spherical harmonic coefficients. Then
during rendering, the reflected radiance is decoded from the
coefficients according to the viewing direction. Thus, the
appearance of the object is preserved and the method is
independent of the surface property of the object.<p>
<dd>
Besides, to display the model interactively, we represent the
object as a multiresolution point-based model and render with
level-of-detail control. A multiresolution point-based viewer is
implemented. Using the viewer, the model is displayed at low
resolution when looking from far away or moving it, and at high
resolution when idle. As a result, interactive frame rate is
achieved.
