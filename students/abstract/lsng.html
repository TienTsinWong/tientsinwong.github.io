In this thesis, we present a novel method to efficiently represent
datasets over the 2D spherical domain based on rhombic
dodecahedron. We propose a new subdivision strategy, a family of
skew great circles, for parameterization of the spherical domain.
The sampling pattern produced over the sphere surface does not
only have low discrepancy, low stretch efficiency and low area
standard deviation, but also allows fast location of sample points
in real time. The data querying process of skew great circle
subdivision strategy can be done through an analytical equation
whereas recursive search is required for existing recursive
subdivision strategy. This can speed up the data sampling and
retrieval process. The effectiveness of this spherical data
representation has been experimented with environment maps, shadow
maps and high dynamic range data. The low discrepancy sampling
pattern results in good rendering quality for environment mapping
application and shadow mapping. The fast data query technique
ensures real time environment mapping to be practical. The nice
structure of the subdivision strategy allows the construction of
spherical quadrilateral-based "quadtree", which is used for
adaptive and deterministic sampling of static and dynamic sequence
of high dynamic range environment maps.
