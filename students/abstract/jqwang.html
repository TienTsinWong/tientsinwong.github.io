<dd> Computer graphics, imaging and visualization nowadays requires
dealing with and performing various analysis on large amount of
data. For example, deformation and skeletal animation of complex
geometries in real-time, multiple-level discrete wavelet transform
on high resolution imaging data, etc. These operations usually are
computational intensive and impose a heavy burden on the CPU,
which are also hard to achieve real-time performance. On the other
hand, with the recent advances in consumer-level graphics
hardware, the current new generation of graphics accelerator now
consists of a graphics processing unit (GPU) which offers
SIMD-based parallel processing power. It doesn't merely do the job
of rendering texture-mapped polygons, but also provide us with
high-precision rendering pipeline and high programmability
nowadays. We can perform other general purpose computing on it
when carefully designed. In this thesis, we have successfully
exploited the power of GPU for computation and processing of both
geometric data and imaging data in the 2 applications -- real-time
character facial and skeletal animation; and multiple levels of
discrete wavelet transform. We develop parallel algorithms to map
our solutions to the GPU SIMD architecture and leverage its power
to give a great performance gain in both applications. These
approaches also offload the intensive computing tasks from CPU and
achieve load balancing between CPU and GPU. At the same time, for
the virtual character project, we also propose a simple and
efficient framework for both facial and skeletal animation, as
well as the seamless integration of them for rendering. The
solutions for supporting multilingual lip synchronization and
integration with text-to-speech system of multiple languages are
also developed.
