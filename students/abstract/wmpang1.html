<dd> In this thesis, we present a novel capturing system for acquiring
image-based object or scene from the real world. More specifically, we
tailor the system for image-based relighting (IBL). Image-based relighting
is a relatively new topic in the area of image-based modeling and rendering
(IBMR). It allows the modification of lighting condition of an image-based
scene. To prepare the image-based scene, one can render several images for
the case of synthetic scene. However for the case of real scene, the data
acquisition is difficult because the viewing and the light vectors have to
be determined as well as the images.
<p>

<dd> While constructing the acquisition system, it is difficult to detect
the lighting direction. Previous systems rely on mechanical framework for
precisely controlling the lighting direction. However, they are difficult to
setup, non-portable and high-cost. The setup also restricts the size of
target objects. Instead, we employ the camera-based tracking technique to
develop a self-calibrated, free-hand and portable acquisition system.
<p>

<dd> Our system consists of portable equipments including a light-weight
web-cam, a hand-held spotlight, a checker board, a DV camera and an ordinary
PC. By attaching the web-cam onto the spotlight, we can track the light
vector by analyzing the orientation of checker board as seen from the
web-cam. The captured illumination data is postprocessed and compressed, so
that the image-based scene can be easily sent by email and relit on ordinary
PCs.
<p>

<dd> We have used the capturing system to acquire different materials
including furry object, anisotropic and glossy surfaces. Relighting are done
on the captured image-based scenes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed capturing system.
