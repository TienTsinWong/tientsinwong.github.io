Segmentation has always been a crucial and challenging topic in
various computer vision and graphics applications. Information
from image features can be incorporated into image segmentation
techniques to make the process more accurate and robust. This
dissertation focuses on encoding these feature information into
the image processing procedures, including image segmentation and
manga stylization rendering.
<p>


The fundamental part of this dissertation includes the discussion
on the construction of the speed function, which is important in
applying the curve-evolution based image segmentation. We firstly
investigate the curvature term in the speed function, and then
show how to transform the image segmentation problem into an
interface propagating problem. We propose two formulations to
enhance the speed function in level set methods, in order to
tackle the segmentation problem of tagged MR images. First, a
relaxation factor is introduced, aiming at relaxing the boundary
condition when the boundary is unclear or blurry. Second, in order
to incorporate human visual sensitive information from the image,
a simple and general model is introduced to incorporate shape,
texture and color features. By further extending this model, we
present a unified approach for segmenting and tracking of the
high-resolution color anatomical Chinese Visible Human (CVH) data.
The underlying relationship of these two applications relies on
the proposed variational framework for the speed function. Our
proposed method can be used to segment the first slice of the
volume data. Then based on the extracted boundary on the first
slice, our method can also be adapted to track the boundary of the
homogeneous organs among the subsequent serial images. In addition
to the promising segmentation results, the tracking procedure
requires only a small amount of user intervention.
<p>

Our method can be naturally applied in the application of manga
stylization rendering. We proposes a novel colorization technique
that propagates color over manga regions exhibiting
pattern-continuity as well as intensity-continuity. The proposed
method works effectively on colorizing black-and-white manga which
contains intensive amount of strokes, hatching, halftoning and
screening. Once the user scribbles on the drawing, a local,
statistical based pattern feature obtained with Gabor wavelet
filters is applied to measure the pattern-continuity. The boundary
is then propagated by the level set method that monitors the
pattern-continuity. Regions with open boundaries or multiple
disjointed regions with similar patterns can be sensibly segmented
by a single scribble. With the segmented regions, various
colorization techniques can be applied to replace colors, colorize
with stroke preservation, or even convert pattern to shading. Base
on the observation of the manga features, we then propose a
framework to generate manga-style backgrounds from real
photographs. It frees manga artists from the tedious and
time-consuming background production. To mimic how manga artists
produce the tidy background, it composes of two major steps, the
line drawing and the screen laying. A line importance model is
proposed to simplify and embolden lines in a stylish way. During
the screen laying, texture analysis is utilized to automatically
match the regions in photographs with screens in the database. Two
types of screening mechanisms are proposed for matching shading &
texture as well as the high-level structures.
