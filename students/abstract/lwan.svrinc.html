Spherical map is the foundation for many applications in computer
graphics, such as environment mapping, precomputed radiance
transfer, radiosity and image-based rendering. For these
applications that involve intensive computation on spherical domain,
it is generally desirable to employ equal-area and uniform spherical
maps as the underlying parameterization. However, equal-area
spherical maps are less exploited in graphics.
<p>

In this dissertation, we first introduce an equal-area spherical
map, HEALPix, which is borrowed from astrophysics. Its associated
sample pattern is uniformly distributed over the sphere surface.
Then we discuss its application in environment mapping. Although the
HEALPix representation is more balanced than the traditional
cubemap, it cannot utilize the built-in hardware operations like
cubemap, and the mipmapping construction is more complicated.
Therefore, its rendering speed is not comparable to that of the
cubemap. This motivates us to invent a new six-face spherical map,
called isocube. Unlike cubemap, isocube is an equal-area mapping,
i.e., each texel spans the same area and is equally important. Due
to the six-face representation, isocube can fit nicely into the
cubemap hardware and hence can fully exploit the hardware operations
tailored for cubemap. In addition, its mapping computation only
involves a small overhead. Therefore the look-up speed for isocube
is very fast.
<p>

Next we discuss another application of HEALPix map, the dynamic
environment sequence sampling. Previous work only considers the
static case where the environment map is approximated by finite
directional light sources. In the dynamic case, the individual
regeneration of samples for each frame may introduce abrupt changes
in the rendering animation. To handle this temporal inconsistency
problem, we propose spherical q$^2$-tree based on HEALPix map. The
adaptiveness of the quadtree can suppress the abrupt changes between
consecutive frames,
and hence a rather smooth rendering can be produced. This method,
however, generates sample pattern independently for each environment
frame, and therefore it may still cause unexpected jumps in some
situations. To fully utilize the temporal coherence in the sequence,
we present a global sampling approach which treats the
dynamic environment sequence as a 3D volume and performs sampling in
the volume.
The volumetric sampling adapts the sample number according to each
frame and restricts the temporal/spatial changes within small
subdivided volumes, and hence ensures a smooth sampling sequence.
Within the framework, we present a volumetric importance metric and
develop a binary-quad tree to perform stratification.
Experimental results show that our volumetric sampling method can
generate light samples with a better temporal consistency.
