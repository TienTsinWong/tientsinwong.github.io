This thesis describes computational approaches to identifying statistical
differentiations in anatomical structures in magnetic resonance images (MRI)
between two groups of subjects, and to detecting the activation regions in
functional MRI (fMRI). The efficacies of the proposed methodologies are
demonstrated by detecting pathological differences in human skulls, brains,
and vestibular systems for the etiology study of the adolescent idiopathic
scoliosis (AIS). 
<p>

A novel framework is proposed to detect morphological changes in the skull
vault extracted from the T1-weighted MRI data. This framework includes 3-D
skull vault segmentation, surface smoothing, distance-based feature
extraction, and discriminative feature subset selection. The results of this
study quantify the skull vault surface changes and point to the potential
abnormality of bone growth regulation in AIS patients. 
<p>

In particular, to automatically segment the skull vault with weak signal in
T1-weighted MRI, we propose a model-based 3-D segmentation method. This
method segments the skull vault using an active shape model, which is
constructed based on the statistical information in skull vault surfaces
segmented from CT data of a group of subjects. For the volumetric layers
like the skull vault, the landmark correspondence is optimized by
incorporating local radial thickness information. 
<p>

Further analysis is performed toward detecting the statistical
neuroanatomical differences. Volume-based morphometry methods have been
applied to measure the statistical brain difference in T1-weighted MRI. To
improve the accuracy of volume-based morphometry, we construct a brain
template with 101 Hong Kong adolescent girls by iteratively using non-linear
registration.
<p>

Besides, kernelized clustering methods, i.e., kernel K-means (KKM), spectral
cluster analysis (SCA), and ellipsoidal support vector clustering (ESVC),
are proposed to detect activation regions in functional MRI time series. KKM
performs K-means clustering in the kernel space. SCA relies on spectral
analysis of the similarity matrix to cluster fMRI time series. ESVC computes
a compact hyper-ellipsoid enclosing the mapped features in the kernel space,
and achieves a set of cluster boundaries in the original space. 
<p>

Moreover, to test the hypothesis that unbalanced perception of the
surroundings contributes to the spine deformity, we perform statistical
surface-based morphometry on vestibular systems in AIS patients and matched
normal controls. In order to obtain exact surface boundary of the vestibular
system, we propose an automatic segmentation pipeline to delineate the
vestibular system in T2-weigthed MRI images. Estimation of the overall
labyrinth geometry is performed by measuring the relationships among the
best-fit planes and the best-fit circles. Statistical shape differences are
detected between AIS patients and normal controls.
