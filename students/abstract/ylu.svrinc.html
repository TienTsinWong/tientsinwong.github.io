<dd> With the increasing popularity of digital camera, organizing and
managing large collection of digital photos effectively are therefore
required. In this thesis, we study the techniques of photo album sorting,
clustering and compression techniques based on the JPEG DCT frequency domain
features, which offers low-cost processing efficiency and excellent texture
information.
<p>

<dd> We utilize the first several non-zero DCT coefficients to build our
feature set and calculate the energy histograms. Based on them, we perform
image similarity analysis in frequency domain directly without having to
decompress JPEG photos into spatial domain first.
<p>

<dd> We first exploit one dimensional photo album sorting and adaptive
clustering algorithms to group the most similar photos one by one. We
further compress those clustered photos by a MPEG-like algorithm with
variable IBP frames and adaptive search windows. Our methods provide a
compact and reasonable format for people to store and transmit their large
number of digital photos at the minimal expense of original image quality.
<p>

<dd> We further study the complex high-dimensional photo album clustering
algorithms. We propose to utilize multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques
to solve the high dimensional feature space and unknown number of natural
categories problems in more complicated clustering process. We calculate the
similarity distances of all pairs of images, then extract the most principal
coordinates that reveal how they are related with each other maximally in
the compact and observable low dimensional space. Multidimensional Scaling
not only provides a favorable visualization layout of all images in terms of
the semantic similarity metric adopted, but also suggests the clustering
results, which group the most similar photos together visually. With the
most significant coordinates generated by MDS, our interactive clustering
algorithms have been proved more effective for digital photo clustering and
navigation than any traditional clustering algorithms.
