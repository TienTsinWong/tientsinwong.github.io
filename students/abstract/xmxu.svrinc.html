Shape analysis is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has
been widely adopted in many applications of computer graphics. In
particular, shape similarity, as one of the core techniques of
shape analysis, plays an important role in shape retrieval,
recognition and classification, alignment and registration, and
approximation and simplification. Its applications in computer
graphics include shape-based image morphing, image mosaic, 3D
reconstruction, image editing, motion inference, and motion
tracking, etc.
<p>

Shape similarity has been deeply studied by many researchers.
However, challenges still remain. The first challenge is the
invariance. Since shape in many applications is often discussed
based on the property of invariance, shape similarity is expected
to be invariant to the transformations (e.g. translation, scale,
orientation). The second one is tolerance. As noise, blur, crack
and deformation are usually introduced when extracting the shape
of an object from an image, a shape similarity metric is required
to be robust to these imperfections. During the design of shape
similarity metrics, it is usually difficult to achieve these
objectives.
<p>

Shape similarity is application dependent. Different applications
may have different requirements on invariance and tolerance. Thus,
it is almost impossible to design an universal metric which is
suitable for all applications. Nowadays, many techniques have
attempted to solve these problems to some extent. But, most of
them only focus on the applications where shape is invariant to
transformation. And the cases where shape transformations may be
taken into account when measuring the shape similarity are seldom
discussed.
<p>


We further explore the applications of shape similarity in
computer graphics. And we especially concentrate on some
challenging problems. Since shape similarity is application
dependent, we need to tailor-make the design of shape similarity
metric in order to satisfy the specific application. In this
thesis, we mainly discuss two applications, animating animal
motion from a still picture, and outline-based ASCII art
generation. Both of them are regarded as challenging problems and
hard to be solved with existing techniques. It is our great
contribution that we observe that the complexity of these
applications can be largely reduced by applying the concept of
shape similarity, so that the corresponding problems become
solvable. In addition, for the first application some existing
shape similarity metrics can be directly applied, while in the
second application the design of a new shape similarity metric is
required.
<p>

Animating animal motion from a still picture, has been regarded as
an impossible task due to the lack of temporal information in a
single picture. However, considering a picture of a moving animal
group, different individuals in the picture usually suggest how
this species moves. This is because different individuals have
similar look and behave asynchronously, so that they can be
regarded as the snapshots of one individual during the motion. And
these snapshots form the key frames of the motion cycle. Hence,
our key contribution is to determine an optimal ordering of
snapshots in order to reconstruct the motion cycle. To achieve
this, we construct a snapshot graph using shape context, an
invariant shape similarity metric. Then the ordered snapshots
(which correspond to the motion cycle) can be deduced from this
graph by minimizing an objective function. To alleviate the pose,
morphology, and appearance variation of the snapshots along the
motion path, we further propose to perform consistency refinement.
Finally, a smooth motion sequence can be synthesized by morphing
among the ordered snapshots.
<p>

Outline-based ASCII art generation is another typical application
of shape similarity. The wide availability and popularity of
text-based communication channels encourage the usage of ASCII art
in representing images. Outline-based ASCII art approximates the
major line structure of the underlying image content. We mimic how
ASCII artists deform the underlying image in order to approximate
the image content with the limited variety of character font
structure. The generation is formulated as an optimization problem
that minimizes the shape dissimilarity, the text resolution, and
the text grid deformation. Shape similarity for character matching
is the basic technique in this application. Here shapes are not
invariant to transformations when we try to measure the similarity
between the shape of characters and the underlying structure.
Moreover, the compared shapes can be substantially different.
Therefore, an alignment-insensitive shape similarity metric which
is variant to transformations as well as robust to misalignment is
also proposed.
