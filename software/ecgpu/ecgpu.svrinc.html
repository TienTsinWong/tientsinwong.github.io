<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <dd>
      <div align="justify"> epgpu performs <strong>Evolutionary Programming</strong> 
        on GPU. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are effective and robust methods 
        for solving many practical problems such as feature selection, electrical 
        circuit synthesis, and data mining. However, they may execute for a long 
        time for some difficult problems, because several fitness evaluations 
        must be performed. We implement a parallel EA on consumer-level graphics 
        cards. Our approach shows the success of using GPU to perform evolutionary 
        computation, and giving a promising parallel solution. We also show that 
        there is not feasible to generate high quality random number on GPU for 
        scientific computation due to the pseudo-integer modulation operators, 
        and short repetition period.</div>

<h3>System Requirement</h3>

<dl>
  <dd>Hardware: Pentium III or above, 128MB RAM, Nvidia GeForce 6 series graphics 
    card<br>
<dd>OS: Windows 98/NT/2000/XP, with OpenGL 
</dl>





<h3>License Agreement</h3>

<blockquote>
Our program is basically a free software. The only requirement is as follow:
once you have received our program, you are agreed to cite our official
paper below in your publications/work that based on our software.

<h3>Installation Instruction</h3> 
  <ol>
    <li> Unzip the <a href="epgpu-0.99b.zip"><tt>epgpu-0.99.zip </tt></a>into a subdirectory, say <tt>epgpu</tt><br>
    <li> Simply run <tt>ep.exe </tt> with the argument setting stated in the 
      <tt>README.txt</tt>
    <li> A window will pop up to visualize the convergence. When you see
         the clear B/W checkerboard, the population converges. The clearer
         the B/W checker pattern is, the more accurate the solution is.

<h3>Why Current GPU Is No Good for High-Quality Random Numbers Generation?</h3>

<blockquote>
For evolutionary computing, the quality of random numbers is extremely
important for generating accurate solution. Serious research requires 
high-quality random numbers with very long repeating period. <p>

Due to the lack of high-precision integer and bitwise operations, we would
like to point out that current GPUs cannot generate high-quality random
numbers because we cannot use large prime numbers in shader program.
Although our current program supports <b>GPU-based</b> random number
generation, we <b> don't recommend</b> it for serious evolutionary computing
research. We <b>highly recommend</b> users to use the <b>software-based</b>
random number generator. Even such software-based random numbers are used,
we still get significant speed-up thank to the GPU parallelization of other
operators.<p>

To demonstrate how the solution accuracy is affected by the quality of
random number, we compare the results of GPU-based and software-based random
number generations. The faster the population converges to the B/W
checkboard pattern (below), the higher the quality of random number is. From the
following screenshots, it can be shown that the quality of random numbers
significantly affects the accuracy. In fact, the population computed with
the GPU-generated random numbers will <b>not</b> converge to the optimal
values as the one with high-quality random numbers. Therefore, in our work,
we do not use GPU for speeding up the random number generation, because we
pay particular attention to the accuracy of result. <p></blockquote>
