<h3>Discrete Wavelet Transform on GPU</h3>

The algorithm is designed and developed by the <a 
href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~crc/">graphics team</a> 
(<a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jqwang/">Jianqing Wang</a>,
<a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ttwong/">Tien-Tsin Wong</a>,
<a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/">Pheng-Ann Heng</a> and
<a href="mailto:eeleungc@cityu.edu.hk">Chi-Sing Leung</a>)
in <a 
href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>. We 
propose a fast GPU algorithm to perform the discrete wavelet transform featuring 
flexible boundary extension schemes, flexible wavelet kernels, Cg shader 
implementation,and high precision. One major beauty of 
our method is that both forward and inverse wavelet transforms are unified using
our position-dependent filtering/convolution 
and the indirect addressing technique.  The software is <b>OPEN SOURCE</b> and 
<b>FREE</b> for any commercial or academic usage.  It is currently beta-released
(version 0.9b) in two forms: (A) <b>Jasper unofficial GPU extension</b>, and (B) <b>standalone DWTGPU C++
class module</b> with demo program. Yes, we have successfully integrated the
software into the well-known JPEG2000 software Jasper. All source codes and
binaries can be downloaded at:
